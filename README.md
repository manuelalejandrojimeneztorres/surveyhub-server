## Description

The **SurveyHub Backend** is a robust, scalable, and enterprise-grade server-side application designed to support comprehensive online survey management. Built using **Node.js** and **Express.js**, this backend implements a secure, efficient, and extensible RESTful API that integrates seamlessly with the **SurveyHub Mobile Application** and **MySQL database**. It serves as the central hub for managing survey data, enforcing business logic, and ensuring secure user interactions.

## Architecture Overview

The SurveyHub Backend follows a modular architecture, ensuring maintainability and scalability. Key components include:

- **Layered Architecture**: Combines the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** pattern with middleware to ensure modularity, maintainability, and scalability.
- **Database Integration**: Utilizes **Sequelize ORM** for robust schema definitions, efficient data operations, and relationship management.
- **API Layer**: Provides secure endpoints for CRUD operations, user authentication, and data processing.
- **Security Measures**: Implements JWT-based authentication, BCrypt for password hashing, and CORS for cross-origin requests.
- **File Management**: Handles multipart form data using Multer for secure profile picture uploads.
